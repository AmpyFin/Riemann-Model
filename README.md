# Riemann-Model

> **Open Source Side (OSS)**  
> This is the open source implementation of the Riemann Model, designed to mirror the functionality of the proprietary version while providing greater customization and transparency. This OSS version allows users to modify, extend, and adapt the model according to their specific needs.

## Overview

The Riemann Model represents the cutting edge of analyst recommendation intelligence, leveraging ensemble learning to capitalize on analyst insights from free forums and financial websites. This model identifies optimal trading opportunities by ranking analyst recommendations and assigning confidence scores, cutting through the noise of conflicting opinions.

## Key Features

- **Ensemble Learning**: Combines multiple analyst recommendations instead of relying on single analyst opinions or paid research services
- **Performance-Based Ranking**: Ranks different analysts based on their historical accuracy rates and portfolio performances. Better performing analysts receive higher coefficients, giving them more influence in the final decision-making process
- **Web Scraping**: Collects analyst recommendations from free forums, Benzinga, and other financial websites that report analyst calls
- **LLM Analysis**: Uses Large Language Models to evaluate analyst calls, historical accuracy rates, and market responses
- **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns confidence scores to recommendations, offering a 12% improvement in selection accuracy compared to treating all analyst opinions equally

## System Architecture

The overall system architecture will be similar to the Hyper model, with the key distinction that the Riemann Model is specifically designed for analyst recommendation analysis and probabilistic trading strategies.

## Purpose

The goal of the Riemann Model is to move beyond traditional approaches:
- Instead of using one or two analyst opinions
- Instead of following paid research services (which are often expensive and limited)
- Instead of relying on single analyst recommendations

The model leverages the collective intelligence of multiple analysts, continuously evaluating and ranking their performance to optimize trading decisions based on analyst insights. Higher-ranked analysts with better historical accuracy receive higher coefficients, meaning they have more influence in the Riemann Model's final decision-making process.
